# Read-Me-Generator

A Node.js application that presents the user with different prompts for information that would go in a README file, and then generates a custom README file with all the information provided.   

# Description

As a developer, it is important to be efficient with time. A thorough README file is also really important for helping other developers and onlookers to understand a given project and how it works. This app was created to help developers have a quick and easy way to create a README file that is up to industry standard, but takes out all the time having to write in the markdown themselves. In short, it is a fast way to get a solid README file written without having to put in much of the work.
